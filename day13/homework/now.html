        <p>Today, bicycles are more popular and advanced than ever before, serving millions of riders around the world for transportation, fitness, and fun. Modern bikes come in a wide range of designs — from lightweight road bikes built for speed to sturdy mountain bikes made for rough trails, and electric bikes that combine pedal power with motor assistance for easier rides. Technology has transformed cycling with innovations such as carbon fiber frames, hydraulic brakes, automatic gears, and smart bike computers that track performance and navigation. Cities around the world are promoting eco-friendly transportation by building more bike lanes and rental systems, making cycling a key part of sustainable urban living. Beyond commuting, cycling has also grown as a global sport and recreational activity, supported by communities, events, and races everywhere. Whether for health, travel, or adventure, the bicycle continues to evolve while remaining one of the most efficient and enjoyable ways to move through the world.</p>
