        <h1>The History Of Bicycles!</h1>

        <p>The history of bicycles began in the early 19th century with a German invention called the “Laufmaschine,” or “running machine,” created by Baron Karl von Drais in 1817. It was made of wood, had two wheels, and was propelled by pushing with the rider’s feet. This early design, also known as the “Draisine,” is considered the first step toward the modern bicycle. In the 1860s, French inventors Pierre Michaux and Pierre Lallement introduced pedals attached to the front wheel, creating the first pedal-powered bicycle known as the “velocipede.” It was made of metal with wooden wheels and earned the nickname “boneshaker” because of its rough ride on cobblestone roads. During the 1870s, the British inventor James Starley developed the “penny-farthing,” a bicycle with a very large front wheel and a small rear wheel. It allowed for greater speed but was difficult and dangerous to ride. The modern safety bicycle was created in 1885 by John Kemp Starley, who used a chain drive to connect the pedals to the rear wheel, along with two wheels of equal size, making it much safer and easier to use. Over time, improvements such as pneumatic tires, gears, and lighter materials turned bicycles into one of the most popular and efficient forms of personal transport in the world. Today, bicycles are used for commuting, recreation, and sport, symbolizing freedom, sustainability, and innovation across generations.</p>
