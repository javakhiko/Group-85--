        <p>In the future, bicycles are expected to become even more innovative, efficient, and integrated with technology and sustainable living. Electric and hybrid bikes will continue to evolve, offering longer ranges, faster charging, and smarter energy management. Advances in materials such as ultra-lightweight composites and self-healing components could make bikes stronger, lighter, and more durable. Smart bikes equipped with GPS, sensors, and connectivity to apps and city infrastructure may enhance safety, navigation, and performance tracking. Urban planning will increasingly prioritize cycling, with more dedicated bike lanes, automated bike-sharing systems, and green transportation networks. Additionally, bicycles could play a major role in reducing traffic congestion and pollution, contributing to eco-friendly and healthy lifestyles. As innovation and awareness grow, the bicycle will remain a vital, versatile, and sustainable way to move in the cities and communities of the future.</p>
